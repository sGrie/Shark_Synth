The keys 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 represebt the black keys
The sound tone begins to play when a specific key is pushed and ends when the key is lifted
There are sometimes issues if multiple keys are pressed at once
so for best results stick to one key at a time
keys will light up when in use

the starting octave is 4 which is displayed by a label at the bottom

there is a slider to the right for volume, which goes from 0% (no sound at all) to 100% (highest output)
the volume is also displayed at the bottom
