# Shark_Synth
I am trying to build a simple synthesizer with a few basic parameters
It will be played with the keyboard and be tuned to the keys of a normal keyboard
I will include a master volume control and some control about what type of waveform to play(sine wave, square wave, sawtooth wave, white noise)
The synth will be useful for playing music directly from your laptop and if all goes well I would like to make it very customizable
The basics of this project should not be too crazy I don't think
It might get a bit more complicate if I try making a digital example of the keys in the gui but otherwise it shouldn't be anything crazy
I would like to focus on getting a simple working version out first and then making it much more customizable
